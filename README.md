We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency.

Given two strings, and , that may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make and anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings. The strings consist of lowercase English alphabets.

Example:

a = 'cde'

b = 'dcf'

Delete e from a and f from b so that the remaining strings are cd and dc which are anagrams. This takes 2 character deletions.
